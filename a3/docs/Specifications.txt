> CIS*4800 - Assignment 3 - Textures and Shadows
> ----------------------------------------------
> Due: Monday, March 14, at midnight
> 
> Write an OpenGL program which applies a texture to a cube and creates a moving
> shadow of the cube. 
> 
> Create a scene which has a cube drawn sitting on a plane. Make the plane
> a medium gray colour. Position the viewpoint so it can clearly see the top
> and two sides of the cube. Do not place the cube so close to the viewpoint
> that the shadow it creates is difficult to see.
> 
> The q key should exit your program.
> 
> Part I - A Moving Light
> -----------------------
> Place a light in the scene which is above the cube and rotates around it.
> Make the light move fast enough that it is easy to see but not so fast that
> the motion is difficult to see. It should be possible to see the surfaces
> of the cube become lighter when the light is facing them. Choose lighting
> parameters that do not make the scene too bright or too dark to see clearly.
> 
> Part II - Texturing
> --------------------
> Apply texture maps to the cube using the built in OpenGL texturing functions.
> 
> Read the sample textures from the provided .ppm files. These are similar
> to the .pgm files from assignment 2 but they contain colour images
> instead of only gray scale images. The files contain red, green, and blue
> values for each pixel instead a single gray value. 
> 
> The file format is:
> 
>    P3
>    width height depth
>    r g b
>    r g b
>     ...
> 
> The P3 is a header which indicates a colour ASCII file.
> The height and width are the dimensions of the image. The depth is the
> maximum value of any of the r, g, b colour values.  The r g b values  are
> the image information. Any type and amount of whitespace can appear between
> any of the fields in the file. Comments can appear on any line starting
> with a #.
> 
> Once you have loaded a texture you should then apply it to all surfaces of
> the cube. Set the parameter so the texture is easy to see on the cube.
> 
> Configure the 1 key to change which texture is applied to the object.
> There are seven sample textures provided. Move to the next texture each time 1
> is pressed. When on the last texture and the 1 key is pressed return to the
> first texture.
> 
> 
> 
> Part III - Fake Shadows
> -----------------------
> 
> Create a shadow for the cube using Jim Blinn Fake Shadows. Make the shadow
> a solid dark gray colour.
> 
> The shadow should rotate around the cube as the light source moves.
> 
> You can choose to create local or infinite shadows.
> 
> The initial position of the shadow may not be correct using the standard
> transformation matrix. You may need to change the orientation of the shadow
> for it to appear correct.
>

> Handin Notes
> ------------
> 
> Submit the assignment using the dropbox for assignment 3 in Courselink.
> 
> Include a readme.txt which contains your name, student number, and a short
> description of any parts of the program which do not function correctly.
> 
> Your code must run on the Macs in Reynolds 114.
> 
> Submit your source files necessary to compile your code, a makefile that
> will compile the code, and any other file necessary to build the project.
> The assignment will be compiled following these steps by:
>         -unpacking your submission (tar or zip)
>         -typing make
>  	  -run a3 from the command line
> Any executables in the directory will be removed before make is run.
